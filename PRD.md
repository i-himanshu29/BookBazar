# BookBazaar – REST API for Online Bookstore

## Description
To build a backend API for an online bookstore that allows users to browse, purchase, and review books. The project simulates a lightweight e-commerce system with real-world backend design challenges.

## End Goal
- Working backend with full CRUD for books, reviews, orders
- JWT-based user authentication
- API key generation to access product and order routes
- Middleware for authentication and key verification
- Full Postman collection with testable endpoints and examples
- Bonus: Razorpay payment integration

## Tables to be Created
- users
- api_keys
- books
- reviews
- orders
- cart_items (bonus enhancement)
- payments (bonus, for mock gateway)

## API Routes to Build

### Auth & API Key
- POST /auth/register → Register user
- POST /auth/login → Login user
- POST /auth/api-key → Generate new API key
- GET /auth/me → Get user profile

### Book Routes
- POST /books → Add a book (Admin only)
- GET /books → List all books (public, supports filters)
- GET /books/:id → Get book details
- PUT /books/:id → Update book (Admin only)
- DELETE /books/:id → Delete book (Admin only)

### Review Routes
- POST /books/:bookId/reviews → Add review to a book
- GET /books/:bookId/reviews → List reviews for a book

### Payment Mock API (Bonus)

## Security
- JWT Auth required for reviews and orders
- Admin check middleware for book creation/deletion
- API Key middleware for accessing /books, /orders, /payments

## Enhancements (Bonus)
- Razorpay integration (mock/real) with callback simulation
- Add search, sort, and filters to book list (e.g., by author, genre)
- Cart system using cart_items table
- Pagination for listing endpoints
- Email confirmation on order (mocked or real with Mailtrap)

## Deliverables Checklist
- Auth + API Key (JWT, key generation)
- Book CRUD with Admin checks
- Reviews & Orders functionality
- Middleware (JWT, API Key, Admin)
- DB structure & relationships
- Code structure & quality
- Postman collection
- Bonus features (Razorpay, filters, cart, pagination, email)
